# Deployment

Project is available in production mode on my server : http://dblaze.hopto.org:81

```bash
 npm install react react-dom redux react-redux redux-devtools redux-thunk cross-fetch expect deep-freeze fusioncharts react-fusioncharts react-bootstrap react-router react-router-dom react-datepicker moment react-moment react-bootstrap-router history react-csv --save
 ```
